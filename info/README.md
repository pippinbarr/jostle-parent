## Description
*Won't someone think of the children!? They need food! They need play! They need not to drown! They need not to be electrocuted! Do something for crying out loud! Jostle them!*

Originally released on 10 April 2015, *Jostle Parent* was made in collaboration with [Unwinnable](http://www.unwinnable.com/) for their [Playable](http://www.unwinnable.com/playable/) project. It was written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) using the [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com/) library. The music and sound effects in Jostle Parent were made with a combination of [bxfr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).

In June of 2022 I was finally able to convince HaxeFlixel to rebuild the game as a browser-friendly HTML5 version (and Mac and Windows releases too). Nice!
