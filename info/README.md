# Jostle Parent

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description

Jostle Parent was made in collaboration with [Unwinnable](http://www.unwinnable.com/) for their [Playable](http://www.unwinnable.com/playable/) project. It was written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) using the [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com/) library. The music and sound effects in Jostle Parent were made with a combination of [bxfr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).
