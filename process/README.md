# Process

*Jostle Parent* was a game whose process documentation spread out all over the place. I've done my best to collect some of the pieces back together.

* Read my [public-facing blog post](./blog.md)
* Read my [design and development journal](./journal.md)
* Read [The Angst Affairs](./the-angst-affairs), a series of letters between me and Teddy Diefenbach hosted by [*Unwinnable*](https://unwinnable.com/?s=angst+affairs) about our in-progress games (for me this was *Jostle Parent*)
