I wrote about *Jostle Parent* in a number of formats (making it pretty confusing frankly). There was my public blog, a series of letters to Teddy Diefenbach, a secret diary, and so on. I'll try to reproduce as much as I can here.

### Words: The Angst Affairs (2022-06-22)

I should report that I am writing this series withÂ Teddy Diefenbach called &#8220;[The Angst Affairs](http://www.unwinnable.com/?cat=13816)&#8221; on Unwinnable. Basically it&#8217;s a series in which we&#8217;re writing each other an email once per week to report in on the trials and tribulations of working on the game we promised to make &#8220;live&#8221; for the Unwinnable Kickstarter (which got funded, obviously! Nice!). So Teddy is working on quite a personal game called Need (you can read about it in the Angst Affairs) and I&#8217;m working on my sequel/prequel to [Jostle Bastard](http://www.unwinnable.com/2013/11/19/playable-jostle-bastard/#.U9_geYCSzkY) called, at the moment, Jostle Parent.

Anyway this means that I&#8217;m writing about Jostle Parent all over the place (it feels like). I&#8217;m writing about it to Teddy, and then that&#8217;s turning up on Unwinnable, and then I&#8217;m writing about it &#8220;in secret&#8221; on a secret blog for Kickstarter backers (who can also play incremental builds as I develop it), and then I&#8217;m writing about it in my diary and so on. So it&#8217;s endless and it leaves me not super inclined to write about it here? So if you&#8217;re interested go read about it somewhere else, is what I&#8217;m saying? The Angst Affairs is probably the right place, I think. Geez, what an awesome blogpost.

Don&#8217;t thank me, I&#8217;ll thank you.
