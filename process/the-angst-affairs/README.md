# The Angst Affairs

*Jostle Parent* was built as part of a collaboration with the online publication [*Unwinnable*](https://unwinnable.com/) and part of the process involved Teddy Diefenbach and I exchanging a series of letters about our design and development process. It was called "The Angst Affairs."

The series is [still available on *Unwinnable*](https://unwinnable.com/?s=the+angst+affairs) miraculously but I've quietly created my own copy here for posterity. (Hope that's okay, *Unwinnable*!)

So here are the exchanges, from 1-17:
